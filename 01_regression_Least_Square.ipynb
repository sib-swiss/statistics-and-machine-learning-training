    "Most of the time you are not sure of the model you want to fit. You might have a broad idea of the different forms of the function but you don't really know for example what would be the best degree for your poynomial or if all the covariables are actually necessary. Of course you could say \"I am keeping the model that fit the best in term of $R^2$\". But the question really is : is that bunch of extra parameters that are complexifying my model worth the increase in $R^2$?\n",
    "\n",
    "We touched that question in 1.4 by asking about the significance of parameters values. Again if you are confident on the noise distribution you are dealing with (let's say it is normally distributed), and you have a function in mind but you don't know if you should include 1,2 or $p$ covariables then the problem is easy: you can use a log-likelihood ratio test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Likelihood ratio test (LRT)\n",

    "We already mentioned the likelihood, or log-likelihood, several time. \n",

Suffice to know for now the **likelihood is a metric of goodness of fit of your model to your data** which possess interesting mathematical properties when it comes to comparing different models. \n",

    "Furthermore, it is computed for you by `statsmodels.OLS` and is part of the fit summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform a Likelihood Ratio Test you just have to calculate the difference between the maximised log-likelihood of the two models you are comparing. \n",
    "You can estimate the significance of that difference either by using a test statistic (approximate method, which we will show) or by using simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LRT are to be used in the case of **nested function comparisons**. Nested functions are functions that have the same form but differ in the number of parameters used : for example comparing $y=\\beta_1 x_1 +c$ and $y=\\beta_1 x_1 +\\beta_2 x_2 +c$. In this course this will always be the case (but just remember that outside of this course you might want to do other comparison, so be careful).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Briefly :**\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to compare model $M_0$ and $M_1$, respectively having $\\{\\beta_{1,0}\\}$ and $\\{\\beta_{1,2},\\beta_{2,2}\\}$ as parameters. You want to see if adding this extra parameter $\\beta_{2,2}$ is worth it.\n",

    "$$2*(l(X;\\hat{\\beta}_{1,2},\\hat{\\beta}_{2,2})-l(X;\\hat{\\beta}_{1,0}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the hat represents the maximum likelihood estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LRT statistic asymptoptically, for your sample size going to infinity, follows a **chi-square distribution with a number of degree of freedom equal to the difference between the number of parameters in your models**. You have thus access to a P-value which will help you to decide if complexifying your model is worth it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically this LRT statistic could be viewed as a difference in terms of goodness of fit. If this difference is big compared to the goodness of fit of the model with fewer parameters then it is interesting to keep the complexified model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed if this LRT statistic is big then the P-value will be low, and you will tend to reject the null hypothesis that the two models have the same (or non-significatively different) goodness of fit to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note how in the LRT statistic I have put the complex model first then the simple model.\n",
    "\n",
